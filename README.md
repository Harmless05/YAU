# YAU [Documentation is WIP]
YimAutoUpdater aka YAU is a simple application to update [YimMenu](https://github.com/YimMenu/YimMenu), Lua scripts and inject YimMenu with customizable options

YAU is based on [Yim-AutoUpdater](https://github.com/Harmless05/Yim-AutoUpdater), a PowerShell script with all the same great features, but in a console window. 

I made YAU because I felt the UI in Yim-AutoUpdater was a little complicated, and this new version as an .exe file is much simpler and faster to use.

## How to use it

Download the application from [Releases](https://github.com/Harmless05/YAU/releases/latest) or [Download the repo](https://github.com/Harmless05/YAU/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

YAU will automatically check for new updates when they are available, but you can always choose to disable this.

### Features
Here's a short list of some of the most important features of YAU

- Automatically check and download the latest version of YimMenu
- Inject YimMenu directly from YAU
- Automatically launch GTAV when injecting with your chosen platform (Rockstar, Epic Games, Steam)
- Delay injecting (Useful when injecting GTAV, because YimMenu can't inject right after GTAV starts)
- Use a custom DLL and process if you want
- Automatically close YAU after successful injection
- Download, update and remove YimMenu Lua scripts from the palm of your hand (YAU)
- Dark and light themes (maybe more in the future? ðŸ‘€)
